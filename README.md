## Middlesign
Signed request in golang made easy.

I needed to implement signed requests in a personal project and decided to make a library out of it.

#### How does it work?
It is basically a very generic middleware. You can easily use it it with other popular libraries like [alice](https://github.com/justinas/alice).

Examples of [server](https://github.com/stefanoj3/middlesign/tree/master/example/server/main.go) and [client](https://github.com/stefanoj3/middlesign/tree/master/example/client/main.go).
